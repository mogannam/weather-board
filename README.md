## General info

<p> A project that tracks the current weather and 5 day forecast of a city. Third party APIs are used to pull weather data and store the search history in local storage. Bootstrap and moment are efficiently used to style the website and add features that would otherwise take time away from other features to recreate the wheel. The weather board also has color coding logic to warn the end user of extreme UVI rays.</p>
